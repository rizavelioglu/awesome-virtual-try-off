# ðŸŒŸ A Curated List of Awesome Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF) Research ðŸŒŸ

Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF) is a novel computer vision task that extracts standardized, canonical garment images from single photos of clothed individuals, moving beyond traditional virtual try-on techniques by focusing on precise garment reconstruction rather than model dressing. The task was introduced in [TryOffDiff: Virtual-Try-Off via High-Fidelity Garment Reconstruction using Diffusion Models](https://rizavelioglu.github.io/tryoffdiff).

### Datasets
- 2021, [VITON-HD](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/viton-hd)
- 2022, [DressCode](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/dress-code)

### Demos
- [[ðŸ¤— Space]](https://huggingface.co/spaces/rizavelioglu/tryoffdiff) finetuned Stable Diffusion-v1.4 for VTOFF and introduced `TryOffDiff`.
- [[ðŸ¤— Space]](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ginipick/FitGen) uses `FLUX.1-dev` and the LoRA `"prithivMLmods/Canopus-Clothing-Flux-LoRA"` to generate clothes from text.
- [[ðŸ¤— Space]](https://huggingface.co/spaces/xiaozaa/cat-try-off-flux) trained a new model "cat-try-off-flux" based on `FLUX.1-dev` and `CatVTON`.
